    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
        Shigeru Miyamoto (born November 16, 1952) is a Japanese video game designer, producer and game director at Nintendo, where he serves as one of its representative directors as an executive since 2002. 
        Widely regarded as one of the most accomplished and influential designers in the history of video games, he is the creator of some of the most acclaimed and best-selling game franchises of all time, including Mario, The Legend of Zelda, Donkey Kong, Star Fox and Pikmin.

        Born in Sonobe, Kyoto, Miyamoto graduated from Kanazawa Municipal College of Industrial Arts. 
        He originally sought a career as a manga artist, until developing an interest in video games. 
        With the help of his father, he joined Nintendo in 1977 after impressing then-president Hiroshi Yamauchi with his toys. 
        He helped create art for the arcade game Sheriff, and was later tasked with designing a new arcade game, leading to the 1981 game Donkey Kong.

        Miyamoto's platform game Super Mario Bros. (1985) and the action-adventure game The Legend of Zelda (1986) helped the Nintendo Entertainment System dominate the console game market. 
        His games have been flagships of every Nintendo video game console, from the arcade machines of the late 1970s to the present day. 
        He managed Nintendo's Entertainment Analysis & Development software division, which developed many Nintendo games, and he played an important role in the creation of other influential games such as Pokémon Red and Blue and Metroid Prime. 
        Following the death of Nintendo president Satoru Iwata in July 2015, Miyamoto became acting president alongside Genyo Takeda until he was formally appointed "Creative Fellow" a few months later.

        Miyamoto, and Nintendo as a whole, do not use focus groups. 
        Instead, Miyamoto figures out if a game is fun for himself. 
        He says that if he enjoys it, others will too. 
        He elaborates, citing the conception of the Pokémon series as an example, "And that's the point – Not to make something sell, something very popular, but to love something, and make something that we creators can love. 
        It's the very core feeling we should have in making games."
        Miyamoto wants players to experience kyokan; he wants "the players to feel about the game what the developers felt themselves."
