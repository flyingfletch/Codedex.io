    <h1>Police in Dahmer Case Admit Making Mistake</h1>
    <h2>Two police officers dismissed last summer for unwittingly handing over a dazed, naked Laotian boy to the serial killer Jeffrey L. Dahmer have admitted that they acted improperly.</h2>
    <h3>October 16th, 1992</h3>
    <p>
        The admission had heading off what threatened to be a divisive new inquiry into the matter.<br/>
        <br/>
        The two former officers, Joseph Gabrish, 29 years old, and John Balcerzak, 35, said at a hearing of the five-member Fire and Police Commission on Tuesday night that they had failed to investigate properly.<br/>
        <br/>
        They had appealed their dismissal to the board, which was planning up to three weeks of hearings into the affair. Instead, the board adjourned until Oct. 27, at which time it will decide if the discharges were justified.
