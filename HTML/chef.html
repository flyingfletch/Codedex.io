            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. 
            Lightly spray a 9 x 13-inch pan with non-stick cooking spray and set aside.

            Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. 
            When butter is melted and bubbly, add flour and stir to combine. 
            Continue cooking, whisking continuously until mixture is light golden grown, about 2-3 minutes.
            Slowly add chicken broth, whisking until smooth. 
            Whisk in garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, coriander, chili powder, and pepper. 
            Bring sauce to a simmer and stir until thickened, 3-4 minutes.
            Remove from heat and whisk in sour cream and hot sauce.
            Add salt to taste and set aside.

            In a separate mixing bowl, soften cream cheese in microwave until it is easily stirred.
            Add green chiles and 1/2 cup of reserved sauce.
            Stir to combine and add chicken and 2 cups Monterey Jack cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
            To make the tortillas easier to roll, place between damp paper towels and microwave 15-20 seconds. 
            Place about 1/3-1/2 cup chicken mixture on each tortilla and roll tightly.
            Pour 1 cup sauce into the bottom of prepared pan and spread evenly.
            Place tortillas snugly in pan.
            Pour all remaining sauce on top of the tortillas and top with remaining 2 cups cheese.
            Bake 30-35 minutes, until hot and bubble throughout and cheese is melted.
