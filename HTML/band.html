            <p>
                <b>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift">Wikipedia</a>:</b><br/>
                <br/> 
                Swift helped shape the modern country music scene, having extended her success and fame beyond the U.S. pioneered the use of internet (Myspace) as a marketing tool, and introduced the genre to a younger generation.
                Country labels have since become interested in signing young singers who write their own music; her guitar performances contributed to the "Taylor Swift factor", a phenomenon to which upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.

                According to publications, Swift changed the contemporary music landscape "forever" with the genre transitions across her career, a discography that accommodates cultural shifts, and her power "to pull any sound she wants into mainstream orbit".
                Furthermore, in being personal and vulnerable in her lyrics, music journalist Nick Catucci opined Swift helped make space for later singers like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.
                Scholars have also highlighted the literary sensibility and poptimist implications of Swift and her music in the 21st century.
